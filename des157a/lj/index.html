            <h2>Game Design UX Best Practices</h2>
            <p>Amir Dori opened <a href="https://uxplanet.org/game-design-ux-best-practices-guide-4a3078c32099">the article</a> with a summary of his job history and experience, and it really helped set a professional tone for the article. I was much more interested in reading the article after hearing just how much data Amir has seen in game design.</p>

            <p>All of his insights are clearly stated and with direct evidence and explanation, which makes it a very useful article to come back to for reference. However, I found that the moral line that Amir puts forward in this article is one I strongly disagree with. For example, this article shows how links to monetized content can be placed in the easiest places to reach to both entice the viewer and to encourage accidental touches, and the tactic of making it harder to exit the game because of the exit dialogue.</p>

            <p>I understand that Amir is simply relaying data gathered with the express purpose of increasing play time and ultimately revenue, but as a consumer that loves gaming, I was sad to hear it. These are the forces that alienate mobile games from gaming enthusiasts, and perpetuate the cycle of shallow, uninspiring mobile games that provide neither critical thinking or captivating storytelling for the user. While the wealth of information contained in this article is still of great use, I hope I can also use it to steer clear of some of the mobile games industry’s pitfalls.</p>

            <h2>Personal Photo Analysis</h2>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/grasses.jpg" alt="photograph of beach grasses">
                <figcaption>&copy; Adam Overmeer</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>This is a photograph I took in the Bodega Bay. What makes it work so well to me is the lack of specific scale: all we get in the photograph is the smooth sky gradient and the field of grasses. Without any people or objects, the size of the grasses is ambiguous, which helps emphasize their texture and pattern, instead of their context relative to another object. I also really enjoy the contrast between the blue sky and the tan grass; the sky being one smooth gradient and the grasses being a sea of texture and shadow.</p>

            <p>This photo has become the hero image in my mind for a series of landscapes I have been shooting, where I use the sky and the horizon to divide landscapes into blocks of pattern and texture. This image is a perfect example of how I am looking to highlight those patterns and textures outside of their larger context, to draw them out horizontally and let them continue off into the horizon.</p>

            <p>What this series reflects in me is the way that I see the world—objects broken into textures, color blocks, and patterns. This focus appears across my photography and my design work, and is something I draw on heavily to influence my visual style.</p>

            <h2>Partner Photo Analysis</h2>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/alisimages.jpg" alt="6 photos of cars with funny custom license plates">
                <figcaption>&copy; Ali Vargas</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>These images capture stories about people, told through their license plates. While these images all center on the license plate, it is the whole context that makes these images interesting. On the top right, the license plate says “ALIEN”, but the plate also says “US” on it, changing the message to “US ALIEN”. Likewise, on top middle, the message “MISTAKE” is much funnier when presented on the back of an old Escalade that has likely depreciated heavily since it was bought.</p>

            <p>These images capture a snapshot of someone’s life, and each contain way more clues than just the license plate. They show the year and make of the car, what type of license plate frame they added, and even what month the car was bought based on the registration.</p>

            <p>What is most mysterious are the details left unanswered. Why is the owner of the bottom center Camaro calling himself “MR SOUP”? Or is that the car’s name? Why exactly was the Escalade a “MISTAKE”? As much data as these images hold, they also allude to a larger story—they are snapshots of people’s entire lives.</p>

            <h2>Photos from the Web</h2>
            <p>Recently, I found the blog <a href="https://mynothingnewyear.com/">My Nothing New Year</a>, in which the owner logs every purchase or trade they made for the year, in an attempt to only buy secondhand. For each item in over 150 entries, they logged a bunch of data about the item, and also included for each item a hand-drawn illustration of the item in a cute, cartoony style. The act of drawing each item likely forced them to closely examine each new item to identify its salient characteristics. It also meant that they had to take the time out of their day to do the drawings, which I would imagine would remind them to slow down and contemplate every purchase made. Given that their objective was to break out of the consumerist mindset, the extra time and thoughtfulness taken to create these drawings probably helped to remind them of why this project was so important.</p>

            <p>I really like the idea of reinforcing this project with individual illustrations, as for me it would definitely help keep my focus on the goal of reducing waste and being thoughtful about each purchase I make.</p>

            <h2>Modal best practices</h2>
            <p>Naema Baskanderi’s <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</a> was a clear outline of how modals can be incredibly useful—or incredibly harmful—to the execution of a strong website. For me, pretty much all of this reading was review of things I already knew. The internet is saturated with modals, so I already have a lot of experience with what makes a good modal experience, and what makes a really bad one. For me, the two main pain points for a bad modal are unclear button labeling, and a lack of escape or close buttons. Unfortunately, those are less products of bad design, and more intentional choices to force users into specific decisions. Since those horrible modals are notoriously widespread, it does mean that avoiding such behavior is even more important in creating a good modal. Users are trained to respond to modals with claustrophobia, and we as designers must respond by presenting a variety of easily accessible exit points for anything that might pop up on the screen.</p>

            <h2>Form design best practices</h2>
            <p>I found <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">this reading</a> very enlightening, as I have definitely found some web forms that felt painless and ones that have felt quite painful. It wasn’t until reading this article that I realized how much science goes into a good form, and how many opportunities there are to go wrong from a usability standpoint. Despite that, I feel much more confident making forms now, as this article also demonstrates how easy it can be to create a good form experience for your user if you just take the time to study the best practices. Before, I thought a good form experience was something elusive, a combination of factors that were difficult to pin down. Instead, this shows that all you need to do to create a great form for any circumstance is to learn and understand these simple rules.</p>

            <p>A website form that I have used a lot recently is the form to list an item to sell on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/create/item">Facebook Marketplace</a>. The form is has a limited amount of info on each page, and clearly shows how many pages are left. Optional fields are clearly marked, and the input boxes vary in size depending on what data they expect. Also, since the form is creating a post, it shows a live view of how your post will look when complete, so you can clearly see how the data you are inputting into the form will look to potential buyers on the site.</p>
