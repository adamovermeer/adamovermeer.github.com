            <h2>Every Picture</h2>
            <p>Recently, I found the blog <a href="https://mynothingnewyear.com/">My Nothing New Year</a>, in which the owner logs every purchase or trade they made for the year, in an attempt to only buy secondhand. For each item in over 150 entries, they logged a bunch of data about the item, and also included for each item a hand-drawn illustration of the item in a cute, cartoony style. The act of drawing each item likely forced them to closely examine each new item to identify its salient characteristics. It also meant that they had to take the time out of their day to do the drawings, which I would imagine would remind them to slow down and contemplate every purchase made. Given that their objective was to break out of the consumerist mindset, the extra time and thoughtfulness taken to create these drawings probably helped to remind them of why this project was so important.</p>

            <p>I really like the idea of reinforcing this project with individual illustrations, as for me it would definitely help keep my focus on the goal of reducing waste and being thoughtful about each purchase I make.</p>

            <h2>Modal best practices</h2>
            <p>Naema Baskanderi’s <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</a> was a clear outline of how modals can be incredibly useful—or incredibly harmful—to the execution of a strong website. For me, pretty much all of this reading was review of things I already knew. The internet is saturated with modals, so I already have a lot of experience with what makes a good modal experience, and what makes a really bad one. For me, the two main pain points for a bad modal are unclear button labeling, and a lack of escape or close buttons. Unfortunately, those are less products of bad design, and more intentional choices to force users into specific decisions. Since those horrible modals are notoriously widespread, it does mean that avoiding such behavior is even more important in creating a good modal. Users are trained to respond to modals with claustrophobia, and we as designers must respond by presenting a variety of easily accessible exit points for anything that might pop up on the screen.</p>

            <h2>Form design best practices</h2>
            <p>I found <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">this reading</a> very enlightening, as I have definitely found some web forms that felt painless and ones that have felt quite painful. It wasn’t until reading this article that I realized how much science goes into a good form, and how many opportunities there are to go wrong from a usability standpoint. Despite that, I feel much more confident making forms now, as this article also demonstrates how easy it can be to create a good form experience for your user if you just take the time to study the best practices. Before, I thought a good form experience was something elusive, a combination of factors that were difficult to pin down. Instead, this shows that all you need to do to create a great form for any circumstance is to learn and understand these simple rules.</p>

            <p>A website form that I have used a lot recently is the form to list an item to sell on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/create/item">Facebook Marketplace</a>. The form is has a limited amount of info on each page, and clearly shows how many pages are left. Optional fields are clearly marked, and the input boxes vary in size depending on what data they expect. Also, since the form is creating a post, it shows a live view of how your post will look when complete, so you can clearly see how the data you are inputting into the form will look to potential buyers on the site.</p>
