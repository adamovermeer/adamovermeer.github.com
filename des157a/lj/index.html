            <h2>Form design best practices</h2>
            <p>I found this reading very enlightening, as I have definitely found some web forms that felt painless and ones that have felt quite painful. It wasnâ€™t until reading this article that I realized how much science goes into a good form, and how many opportunities there are to go wrong from a usability standpoint. Despite that, I feel much more confident making forms now, as this article also demonstrates how easy it can be to create a good form experience for your user if you just take the time to study the best practices. Before, I thought a good form experience was something elusive, a combination of factors that were difficult to pin down. Instead, this shows that all you need to do to create a great form for any circumstance is to learn and understand these simple rules.</p>

            <p>A website form that I have used a lot recently is the form to list an item to sell on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/create/item">Facebook Marketplace</a>. The form is has a limited amount of info on each page, and clearly shows how many pages are left. Optional fields are clearly marked, and the input boxes vary in size depending on what data they expect. Also, since the form is creating a post, it shows a live view of how your post will look when complete, so you can clearly see how the data you are inputting into the form will look to potential buyers on the site.</p>
