            <p>Andreas Gursky is a photographer that I look up to, and his website has a lot of elements that I hope to replicate. The site is straightforward and simple, and it lets the photographs shine while still keeping some navigation and text around them. His site does this by keeping the text small and black on a plain white background, so it competes as little as possible with the photos. The persistent nav links are still a bit overpowering, so I will definitely try to minimize how many items stay on the screen at a time. Still, it is clean and very minimal, and lets the power of his photography shine through.</p>

            <h2>Project Goals</h2>
            <p>For my site, my goals are as follows: First and foremost, I want to center the composition around my photo display, and minimize all of the other navigation and information on the page. Second, for the navigation and information that is displayed, I want to make sure that is logical and easy to use. Third, I want to provide a level of polish to the photo scrolling, the navigation, and the site as a whole to give the sophisticated visual presentation a coffee table book. I would like to keep my design very close to Andreas Gursky’s site with a simple layout and small image tag, but simplify it down into a single static page. I will definitely experiment with hiding the UI when the mouse isn’t moving like Monaris’ site does, but I am not sure that will be as user friendly as keeping the UI small and static.</p>

            <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
            <p>As mentioned above, it is my intention to give this site the feel of a coffee table art book: to present the photos boldly and with only simple text around them. For my site, that means keeping the photo in the center of the screen, and making it full bleed or just a slim margin on the top and bottom (or sides for the mobile version). The type will be styled to be very simple, so it can be legible even at smaller sizes, and so it does not detract from the photography. On the photographs, there will be some subtle animation to draw in the user and to blend the moving landscapes with the static sky. Overall, the idea is to keep the imagery at the center, and to only add what is absolutely necessary in the space around it: a couple buttons and a couple words of text.</p>

            <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
            <p>The focus of the site is that the user can scroll through the photos under the same sky, and it is that scrolling that is most important. If the user doesn’t guess to scroll, I will have a message appear to prompt them. Also, on the mobile site, I want to have a suggestion briefly appear to rotate the phone for a better experience. When the user isn’t scrolling, I want the image carousel to snap to the nearest image, and I want text to appear to describe that image. That text should disappear again when the user is scrolling. For all of these prompts and text boxes, I want them to fade in to avoid being jarring. I also want the images to start cycling through on their own if the user doesn’t interact with them. Outside of the photography, I want to keep a little nav bar to hold a couple buttons, but likely only two or three. I will make them simple icons that will have a one or two word description that would appear on hover like a tooltip.</p>

            <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
            <p>The goal of this project is to present my photography exhibit “under the same sky”, in which several photos are presented using the same sky above each. The rest of the site is just meant to support this exhibition, with minimal text and only the necessary navigation options. I will have a button to read a small blurb about the exhibit, and I might have an introductory message when the site loads. I want the user to be able to just watch the slideshow passively, or to scroll to the overlap between two landscapes if they wish. I want the users to be able to seamlessly scroll through the landscapes, so that they may examine the exhibit however they wish.</p>
